[Chorus or hook]
I carried their burdens, but I’ll make a new way,
No child of mine will pay debts I didn’t repay.
Traded my wonder for duties and roles,
But I’ll give them the freedom to wander, be whole.
Where I was a caretaker too early, too fast,
I’ll be the support that lets innocence last.
I’ll guide, not impose, as they find their own light,
A parent who nurtures, not shadows their sight.
I’m seeking true riches, where roots can run deep,
Leaving gold glimmers for memories to keep.
For joy over judgment, and love without chains,
Living light-hearted, released from past pains.

[Verse 1]
Shouldering sorrows that aren't mine to bear,
A boy turned backbone, always aware.
Mending mom’s moments, patching up pain,
Silent in sacrifice, sunshine turned rain.

Picking up pennies where promises fell,
Dad’s debts like shadows, tough truths to tell.
A budget built bare, while he’d borrow and spend,
Leaving scraps of his choices for me to mend.


Rich in their debts, yet poor in my years,
Invested in hope as they cashed out in fears.
A ledger of losses, bills left unread,
Inheriting burdens like fortunes misled.

[Verse 2]
As my pockets run deep, soul feels hollow,
A taste for scotch, debt hard to swallow.
Living high on the hill, yet low in despair,
A fortune in coins, but no time to spare.
I’m stacking up bills but losing my sense,
More wealth piling up, but no recompense.
Gold chains that bind, though I claim I’m free,
A vault filled with riches, yet empty in me.

Seeking dreams unpriced, a purpose that’s clear,
Bound not by gold but by moments held dear.
Purpose, my treasure, the fortune I’ll keep,
A wealth beyond money, a soul running deep.

[Verse 3]
I’ll learn from the weight that was handed to me,
Unbinding the chains, setting myself free.
Where debts of the heart and of pocket collide,
I’m breaking the cycle they left inside.
No more will I shoulder what’s not truly mine,
Stepping out of their shadow, letting light shine.
Roots in resilience, my path carved anew,
Choosing freedom from burdens I didn’t accrue.
For each scar they left, I’ll sow seeds of grace,
Building a life they could never erase.
Growing in wisdom, I’ll plant seeds of peace,
So love—not burdens—is what I’ll release.
